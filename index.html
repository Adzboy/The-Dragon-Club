			str+='<h1>Our History</h1><hr>';
			str+='<p>The Dragon Club was created in late 2021 by LEMMINGUIN for IcyTheFrostWing11 (later VineTheNatureWing11, not on Scratch anymore). Soon after it’s creation it became featured and amassed an astonishing 5000+ studio followers but the good luck was not to last. In 2022, the account was deleted as the owner deleted all their projects and studios. A backup studio quickly put into effect but the damage had been done. Everything was lost. The codeword is scales. Since then, the studio has bounced back with more than 650+ studio followers (as of April 2023) but has never and likely will never be returned to it’s former glory. As of now, I, Adzboy am the current host. And the story continues…</p>';
