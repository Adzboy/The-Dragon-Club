# The Rules
Here are the rules in a simple, easy to understand format:

➸ No Advertising

➸ This studio accepts everyone regardless of gender, race, beliefs, religions, etc. Anyone who is rude to someone else for any will be removed from the club and reported.

Please don't ask to be a manager, help out and you may be promoted. Inactive managers may be removed to make room for more active managers. We will let people know when we are looking for new managers.

# Our Past
The Dragon Club was created in late 2021 by [LEMMINGUIN](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/LEMMINGUIN/) for [IcyTheFrostWing11](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/IcyTheFrostWing11/) (later [VineTheNatureWing11](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/VineTheNatureWing11/), not on Scratch anymore). Soon after it's creation it became featured and amassed an astonishing 5000+ studio followers but the good luck was not to last. In 2022, the account was deleted as the owner deleted all their projects and studios. [A backup studio](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/30844654)  quickly put into effect but the damage had been done. Everything was lost. Since then, the studio has bounced back with more than 650+ studio followers (as of April 2023) but has never and likely will never be returned to it's former glory. As of now, I,   [Adzboy](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Adzboy/) am the current host. And the story continues...
